1.I created a text box where the user can type anything.
2.Just below it, a paragraph shows the number of characters typed.
3.The JavaScript listens to the input â€” this means it reacts whenever the user types, deletes, or pastes text.
4.The code then counts the letters and instantly updates the number on the screen.

Learning outcomes:-
-> I learned how to create a text box where people can type.
-> I learned how to display the number of characters typed on the webpage.
-> I learned how to use JavaScript to continuously watch what the user types and update the count in real-time.
